# valo-veto-nodecg

This bundle are designed to work with [Valorant Map Veto Helper](https://github.com/b4iterdev/valo-map-veto.git), which allows displaying veto result or process on boardcast with NodeCG.

valo-veto-nodecg is a [NodeCG](http://github.com/nodecg/nodecg) bundle.
It works with NodeCG versions which satisfy this [semver](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/semantic-versioning) range: `^2.0.0`
You will need to have an appropriate version of NodeCG installed to use it.

## Demo (This template include no background and transparent, so you might want to have a background and have this as a browser source on top of it)

## Developing

Use the following commands:

-   `npm run build`: Build the project once.
-   `npm run watch`: Build the project and automatically rebuild on changes.
-   `npm run dev`: Build the project, automatically rebuild on changes, launch the NodeCG server, and automatically restart the NodeCG server on changes.
    -   Only restarts the NodeCG server when server-side (i.e. extension) code changes. Changes to client-side code (i.e. dashboard panels and graphics) will not cause the server to restart, nor will they cause browser tabs to automatically refresh.
